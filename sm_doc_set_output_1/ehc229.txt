Death
of
a
Salesman
In
the
play
Arthur
Miller’s
Death
of
a
Salesman
Willy
Loman
asympathetic
salesman
and
despicable
father
who’s
“life
is
a
casting
off”
has
some
traitsthat
match
Aristotle’s
views
of
a
tragic
hero
Willy’s
series
of
“ups
and
downs”
is
identicalto
Aristole’s
views
of
proper
tragic
figure
a
king
with
flaws
His
faulty
personality
thefinancial
struggles
and
his
inabiltity
are
three
substantital
flaws
that
contribute
to
hisfailure
and
tragic
end
Willy
an
aging
salesman
who
sells
nothing
is
abused
by
the
buyers
andrepeatly
borrows
money
from
Charley
to
make
ends
meet
He
is
angered
by
the
way
hisboss
Howard
fired
him
after
working
for
thirty
four
years
at
the
same
company
“Youcan’t
eat
the
orange
and
throw
the
peel
away
a
man
is
not
a
piece
of
fruit
”
Miller
Willy
is
battling
for
his
life
fighting
to
sustain
a
sense
of
himself
that
makes
it
worthwhileliving
at
all
in
a
world
which
seemingly
offers
less
and
less
space
for
the
individual
Now
If
it
is
true
that
tragedy
is
the
consquence
of
a
man’s
total
complusion
to
evaluatehimself
justly
his
destruction
in
the
attempt
posits
a
wrong
or
an
evil
in
hisenvironment
And
this
is
precisely
the
morality
of
tragedy
and
its
lesson
The
discoveryof
the
moral
law
which
is
what
the
enlightenment
of
tragedy
consists
of
is
not
thediscovery
of
some
abstract
or
metaphysical
quantity
miller
common
man
His
problem
is
that
he
has
so
completely
accepted
the
values
of
his
society
that
he
judgeshimself
by
standards
rooted
in
social
myths
rather
than
human
necessities
This
lack
ofinsight
is
strikingly
similiar
to
traits
of
the
tragic
hero
As
Aristotle’s
writes
the
tragichero
“Lives
for
honor
and
fame”
The
glaring
point
of
his
faulty
personality
of
neglecting
others
includesthose
closest
to
him
his
wife
Linda
and
his
two
sons
Biff
and
Happy
“You’ll
retire
mefor
life
on
seventy
goddamn
dollars
a
week
”
Miller
is
evidence
of
the
cruelty
Willycan
show
toward
Happy
as
he
does
to
Biff
Willy
puts
enormous
pressure
on
his
olderson
Biff
to
help
him
out
in
his
time
of
need
“Hap
Willy
got
to
understand
that
I’m
notthe
man
somebody
lends
that
kind
of
money
to
”
Miller
In
the
past
Biff
wentunexpectly
to
Boston
to
a
hotel
where
Willy
was
staying
and
begs
Willy
to
come
back
toNew
York
and
convince
his
math
teacher
to
give
him
a
“passing
grade”
in
a
math
courseso
he
can
graduate
on
time
While
there
Biff
sees
the
‘WOMAN’
in
his
father’s
hotelroom
Willy
at
first
claims
she
is
in
the
room
because
her
shower
is
broken
then
hechanges
the
story
and
says
he
knows
her
through
work
“They’re
painting
her
room
so
Ilet
her
take
a
shower
here
Go
back
go
back
”
Miller
It
did
not
get
much
better
athome
either
He
constantly
puts
down
his
wife
and
hates
it
when
she
interrupts
him
in
hisconversations
with
Biff
and
Happy
Willy
reacts
angrily
“
to
LINDA
Stop
interrupting
”
Miller
Willy
does
the
best
as
he
know
how
because
his
father
was
never
there
forhim
Despite
the
good
influence
Willy
has
on
his
wife
and
two
sons
he
is
a
good
father
tohis
sons
because
he
spends
time
with
them
For
the
most
part
he
is
a
decent
husbandwho
never
abused
his
wife
but
his
wrongs
outweight
the
postive
things
he
did
do
for
hisfamily
He
has
a
difficult
time
selling
anything
to
earn
money
“A
hundred
andtwenty
dollars
My
god
if
business
don’t
pick
up
I
don’t
know
what
I’m
going
to
do
”
Miller
He
works
very
hard
he
has
nothing
to
show
for
it
He
decides
that
it
was
hardfor
him
to
travel
to
places
of
business
and
asks
his
boss
Howard
if
he
can
work
closer
tohome
in
New
York
He
gets
fired
for
asking
His
financial
struggles
continue
with
latebills
and
no
payment
for
his
premium
insurance
he
is
going
deep
into
debt
He
ignores
theproblems
and
thinks
that
everything
is
going
to
be
all
right
Because
of
the
boomingeconomy
he
is
left
behind
in
the
dust
everybody
competes
for
positions
in
their
respectiveprofessions
in
the
world
of
America’s
business
For
if
it
is
true
to
say
that
in
essence
the
tragic
hero
is
intent
upon
claiming
his
wholedue
as
a
personality
and
if
this
struggle
must
be
total
and
without
reservation
then
itautomatically
demonstrates
the
indestructible
will
of
man
to
achieve
his
humanity
miller
common
man
He
worries
for
his
family
so
he
decidesl
himself
by
getting
in
his
vehicle
and
crashing
intoan
object
so
his
family
could
get
money
from
insurance
Ironically
this
trait
matchsAristotle’s
views
of
a
tragic
hero
“His
heroic
qualities
contribute
to
his
downfall
”
Willy
at
times
is
a
despicable
character
who
complains
about
the
bad
luckthat
has
befallen
him
He
is
also
at
times
a
sympathetic
character
who
has
no
control
overcertain
things
in
his
life
that
which
cause
him
hardships
Some
of
Willy’s
traits
matchAristole’s
views
of
a
tragic
hero
a
hero
with
specific
qualities
which
contribute
to
his
owndownfall
Aristole’s
beliefs
that
a
proper
tragic
figure
is
similiar
with
flaws
of
the
maincharacter
in
Arthur
Miller’s
book
