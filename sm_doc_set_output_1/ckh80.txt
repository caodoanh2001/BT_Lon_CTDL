The
sun
was
setting
Far
to
the
east
threatening
black
clouds
arosefrom
the
fumes
of
pollution
from
the
several
smoke
stacks
towering
over
thecity
The
streets
were
pock
marked
and
dented
with
the
recent
shower
ofacid
rain
Hot
boiling
steam
from
the
sewers
made
the
temperature
of
daymuch
hotter
than
it
really
was
Just
outside
the
borders
of
the
city
is
alake
covered
with
muck
and
crude
oil
spills
Death
and
despair
floatedaimlessly
on
the
surface
of
the
unhospitable
body
of
water
Corpses
of
deadfish
seagulls
bobbed
just
under
the
rim
of
the
black
slime
The
blackslime
sensing
fresh
prey
extended
it's
corrupt
and
revolting
tendrilsfarther
until
it
caught
another
unsuspecting
victim
choking
andengulfing
destroying
leaving
just
another
emtpy
shell
behind
devoid
ofany
life
Night
set
in
the
stars
were
obscured
by
thick
blankets
of
smoke
Theday
was
done
Stores
got
ready
to
lock
up
and
street
lights
were
turned
onto
aid
the
bread
winners
so
they
may
travel
safely
Few
were
fortunateenough
to
own
automobiles
so
they
could
avoid
the
cold
dangerous
streetsand
dark
alleyways
Most
shops
were
already
abandoned
finished
for
theday
Yet
few
doors
were
still
open
desperate
for
any
last
minutecustomers
One
such
shopkeeper
was
Phil
Anderson
Anderson
had
worked
asa
pharmacist
for
most
of
his
life
At
forty
he
had
little
to
show
for
The
pollution
that
caused
the
gradual
decay
of
the
city
had
had
negativeeffects
on
business
as
well
as
the
environment
Phil
though
by
all
meansnot
an
old
man
showed
signs
of
premature
aging
His
skin
was
pale
anddry
wrinkled
by
the
everyday
punishment
of
the
deteriorating
sorroundings
Few
strands
of
grayish
white
hair
lined
his
almost
bald
dandruff
infestedscalp
Looking
at
Phil
with
his
characteristic
limp
slouched
posture
andbulging
belly
one
might
think
him
an
extremely
unathletic
person
But
thenagain
it
was
not
entirely
his
fault
His
eyes
were
red
and
bloodshot
theglasses
he
wore
only
made
these
features
more
obvious
With
shaking
skinny
hands
Phil
slowly
put
away
the
last
of
the
itemson
top
of
the
counter
Finally
done
he
flicked
off
the
lights
andrummaged
through
his
pockets
for
his
keys
Looking
one
last
time
to
makesure
the
shop
was
in
order
Phil
locked
up
the
store
and
left
He
failed
to
notice
a
dark
shadow
spying
on
him
as
he
counted
the
bills
he
had
earnedtoday
and
put
it
away
into
his
black
leather
wallet
The
tall
dark
figurestudied
the
pharmacist
a
while
longer
before
trailing
him
The
narrowdirty
street
smelled
of
weeks
old
garbage
and
animal
wastes
Smog
wasstill
thick
in
the
air
causing
him
to
cough
repeatedly
He
stopped
for
amoment
to
catch
his
breath
Remembering
his
air
filter
in
his
pocket
Philgingerly
took
it
out
and
put
it
on
Feeling
much
better
Phil
continueddown
the
street
heaving
a
sigh
of
relief
