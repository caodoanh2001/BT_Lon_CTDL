Every
man
put
on
trial
is
considered
innocent
until
proven
guilty
In
Angry
Men
this
theory
can
almost
be
considered
false
to
the
jurors
involved
in
this
murder
case
But
one
man
can
be
credited
with
sticking
to
the
innocent
until
proven
guilty
theory
that
most
likely
saved
a
man
s
life
This
juror
must
show
other
jurors
that
he
can
prove
with
enough
valid
evidence
that
this
boy
is
be
wrongfully
accused
of
killing
his
father
Reginald
Rose
shows
us
how
that
one
mans
integrity
can
prove
to
make
a
big
difference
in
a
kid
s
life
Juror
can
be
credited
with
saving
someone
s
life
Under
intense
and
hostile
scrutiny
juror
is
the
only
juror
to
vote
not
guilty
on
the
stabbing
death
of
a
boy
s
father
doesn
t
believe
straight
out
that
this
boy
is
innocent
of
this
crime
believes
that
it
would
wrong
to
send
a
boy
off
to
be
executed
without
discussing
it
first
Jurors
and
are
the
most
hostile
of
the
jurors
They
believe
deep
down
that
this
boy
killed
his
father
They
believe
that
everything
they
heard
in
the
courtroom
holds
true
and
they
don
t
really
want
to
see
this
kid
live
any
longer
Juror
still
had
reasonable
doubt
about
the
murder
He
doesn
t
want
to
vote
guilty
until
he
has
enough
evidence
that
this
boy
did
indeed
kill
his
father
Many
different
points
are
made
about
the
boy
who
supposedly
stabbed
his
father
that
are
cross
examined
well
by
juror
who
still
stands
alone
at
not
guilty
All
of
the
evidence
that
the
jurors
found
contains
flaws
in
them
For
instance
the
woman
who
supposedly
witnessed
the
stabbing
wasn
t
wearing
her
glasses
Also
the
stab
wound
in
the
boys
father
was
made
so
that
a
taller
man
or
boy
could
have
made
that
type
of
wound
with
a
switchblade
knife
When
these
key
pieces
of
evidence
becomes
clearer
to
the
jurors
we
start
to
see
jurors
questioning
there
own
guilty
vote
is
the
second
juror
to
vote
guilty
because
he
too
has
some
reasonable
doubt
As
more
evidence
is
put
on
the
table
the
jurors
come
together
and
decide
that
this
boy
is
innocent
In
conclusion
juror
believes
that
every
person
is
innocent
until
proven
guilty
He
was
given
many
pieces
of
key
evidence
that
showed
this
boys
guilt
but
the
evidence
was
examined
carefully
and
as
more
evidence
was
put
out
more
jurors
believed
this
boy
was
indeed
innocent
bringing
them
all
together
to
believe
this
boys
innocence
